This repository (in the subdirectory "paper_numbers") contains Python code that defines variables related to the manuscript:
``Reduction of the dc electric field sensitivity of circular Rydberg states using
non-resonant dressing fields''
by Y. Ni, P. Xu, and J. D. D. Martin
and further work on triplet Helium Rydberg states.

Our main calculation code "import"s these modules, then either:
1) uses the defined variables as parameters in calculations, and/or
2) asserts that the defined variables agree with calculated results.

The number of significant digits shown for calculated quantities are not estimates of their uncertainties.
