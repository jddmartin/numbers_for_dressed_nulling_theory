This repository (in the subdirectory "python/code") contains Python code defining constants and numerical results from the manuscript:
``Reduction of the dc electric field sensitivity of circular Rydberg states using
non-resonant dressing fields''
by Y. Ni, P. Xu, and J. D. D. Martin

Our main calculation code "import"s these modules, then both:
1) uses their defined variables as parameters, and
2) asserts that their calculated results are in agreement with defined variables.

The number of significant digits shown for calculated quantities are not estimates of their uncertainties.
